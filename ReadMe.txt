DATESLATE

A scheduling program created by Zach Hendrix 
for C195: Software II at Western Governers University.
Feel free to contact me at zach.hendrix@wgu.edu or zach.hendrix@yahoo.com
The current version is 1.0 and I can share the version history from my Github upon request.

IDE used: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2020.3.1
Java JDK 11.0.9, JavaFX SDK 11.0.2

How To Use: 
The DATESLATE program works best when connected to a database.
When you log in you will arrive at the Schedule screen. You can click on the "Customer"
button in the top right to add, modify, or delete customers in the database. You can click
the "Add", "Delete", or "Modify" buttons on the scheduling screen to manipulate appointments
on the schedule. You can only delete or modify if you have an appointment selected on the 
schedule.

The report that I chose to use in part A3f of this project was a piechart that shows the
percentages of appointment types, which I have limited to "Business" or "Personal".
